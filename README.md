Insights and Observations
UserDetails Dataset:

Contains no missing values.
User details include location, favorite meal, total orders, etc., making it suitable for demographic and behavioral analysis.
Mean age is around 32 years, and users have an average of ~9.4 total orders.
CookingSessions Dataset:

Contains detailed session information, such as duration and session ratings.
Average session duration is ~30.31 minutes with a mean rating of ~4.52.
No missing values are present.
OrderDetails Dataset:

Missing ratings were appropriately handled by filling them with the mean rating.
Contains information like meal type, dish name, and order status.
Useful for understanding user ordering patterns and preferences.
Suggestions for Analysis
User Demographics:

Analyze the distribution of users by location and age groups.
Investigate the favorite meal preferences across different demographics (e.g., age or location).
Order Behavior:

Examine trends in order frequency and amounts.
Identify the most popular dishes and meal types.
Session and Rating Analysis:

Explore the relationship between session duration and session ratings.
Identify patterns in session timings and their correlation with order amounts or ratings.
Revenue Insights:

Calculate the total revenue generated by each user or meal type.
Identify high-value customers and frequently ordered dishes.
Missing Rating Analysis:

Investigate why some sessions/orders might lack ratings and assess if any patterns exist in the data.
Time-Series Analysis:

Use Order Date to analyze trends over time, such as peak ordering days or seasons.
Visualizations
User Distribution:

python
Copy code
sns.countplot(data=user_details, x='Location')
plt.title('User Distribution by Location')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
Meal Preferences:

python
Copy code
sns.countplot(data=user_details, x='Favorite Meal', palette='viridis')
plt.title('Favorite Meals of Users')
plt.show()
Revenue by Meal Type:

python
Copy code
revenue_by_meal = order_details.groupby('Meal Type')['Amount (USD)'].sum().reset_index()
sns.barplot(data=revenue_by_meal, x='Meal Type', y='Amount (USD)', palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Total Revenue by Meal Type')
plt.show()
Session Duration vs Rating:

python
Copy code
sns.scatterplot(data=cooking_sessions, x='Duration (mins)', y='Session Rating', hue='Meal Type', palette='deep')
plt.title('Session Duration vs Rating')
plt.show()
Order Trends Over Time:

python
Copy code
order_details['Order Month'] = order_details['Order Date'].dt.to_period('M')
orders_over_time = order_details.groupby('Order Month').size()
orders_over_time.plot(kind='line', marker='o', title='Orders Over Time')
plt.show()
Additional Steps
Merge datasets for a consolidated view:
python
Copy code
merged_data = order_details.merge(user_details, on='User ID').merge(cooking_sessions, on='Session ID')
Perform clustering to group similar users based on attributes like Total Orders, Favorite Meal, and Location.
Use machine learning models to predict user ratings or order amounts based on session attributes.
